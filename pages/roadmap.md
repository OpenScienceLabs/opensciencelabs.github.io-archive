# Open Science Labs Roadmap

This is an initial version of Open Science Labs Roadmap.

Topics that were not considered yet on this document but should be added here in the near future are:

* Community Engagement
* Infrastructure
* Social media

In this document, we are focusing on our three current main areas: events, internship and partnership.


## Events

Open Science Labs motivate anyone and any group from the community to organize events about open science and tecnlogies.

For open science and technologies we mean any topic about science or technology that its usage is not restricted by license or agreements. Examples of topics that is accepted:

* Open Source
* Open Data
* Open Access
* Open Science
* Open Source Initiative (OSI) licensed libraries
* Open Source programming languages
* Science using open source software
* DevOps using open source technologies
* Any area of science (if the content is not restricted by a pay wall)

This list is just an example of topics accepted, but it is not limited to that. Some examples of topics that is NOT ACCEPTED:

* Private and restricted projects
* Proprietary technology
* A non open access paper discussion
* A proprietary operation system
* A proprietary programming language


Now, there are two events that is happening periodically:

* PyCaf√©
* DevOps webinars

**Plans:**

For these events, a plan is needed to reach to reach out more people and increase the engagment.

Other meetings that are being considered and that need a greater commitment from the community to make them possible include:

* C++ meetings
* Compilers meetings
* R meetings

Last but not least, when OSL has all these pieces working we will start to plan an **Annual Conference** that should cover topics about open science and technologies.


## Internship

The internship is a great opportunity to involve more people in the project, as well as to provide opportunities for the community to practice and learn from experienced people from around the world.

Interns contribute mainly to affiliated projects (Open Science Labs Partnership), so they will work on open source projects and receives mentoring from other experienced contributors.

With this program, we aim to have them hired for these projects in the near future (depending on their progress).

Interns also work on internal tasks to help Open Science Labs to grow, such as: blog post, PR review, documentation, organization tasks, etc.


**Plans:**

For now, the number of inters that the project can afford is very small, but for this phase, it would be great to have around 10 interns in order to contribute to all the partnerships open source projects and to the Open Science Labs internal tasks.

Also, it would be great to participate to Google Summer of Code as well.


## Partnerships

Partnership program helps us to connect to other projects and work groups in order to expand our network and experiences.

Also, it is a good approach to help the projects to have more visibility and contributions from the community.

In the partnership, we need someone from the partners side that will mentoring the interns that will contribute to their projects.

The desired scenario for the partnership program is when the intern that is contributing to a project is contracted by them, but it is not a requirement.

**Plans:**

The partnership program needs to connect to more projects and, for this phase, it would be great to increase the number of partner to 20 (currently it is 5).
