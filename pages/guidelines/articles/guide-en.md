<!-- # [EN] Editorial Guidelines for Article Creation -->

## General Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to accompany the first steps of OSL collaborators in the elaboration of their posts to be published in our blog.

In reading this guide you will find a simplified basis of the different elements that should be taken into account in the writing of this material.

## Basic characteristics of the posts

- Although translated materials from other languages, correctly referenced, will be admitted, in general the articles must be unpublished. This will improve the positioning of the portal as a reference. Important: Do not address similar topics to previous articles in the blog.
- In the articles we address general topics of open science, open source software used in open science projects, team management, collaborative science, and use of applications, libraries and other specific tools, among others.
- The expected length of posts is up to 900 words. A minimum desirable length is 750 words.
- Each post should be accompanied by a header image or featured image. In recent articles, images have been obtained from some of these sites:
  - <https://www.glazestock.com/>
  - <https://drawkit.com/>
  - <https://undraw.co/illustrations>
- Additionally, depending on the length of the article, there may be internal images that serve as visual support for the ideas presented.
- Use Google Trends to locate reference words for article content.
- Titles must comply with the following characteristics: be short, be linked to the content of the article and invite to read it.
- Emoticons can be added in the titles without abusing them.
- Up to three internal subtitles can be used to separate the sections of the article if necessary. The subtitles have the H2 heading size.
- It is important to include references to the articles we provide from our portal.
- It is also very important to include internal links in the articles. Links to previous articles in the portal, as well as links to the pages of the projects, applications, and tools that are reviewed in it among others.
- Attention to tags, always include them without making them too simple or imprecise.
- The images used must have "Alt" content specified and authorship at the bottom of the image.

## About tone and inclusive language

- The articles are written in a close, simple, direct, clear and precise tone.
- We are not interested in showing wisdom but in sharing knowledge!
- We want to encourage more people to engage in collaborative and open science practices. The tone should be fresh, even in tasks that are a bit more complex to explain, the idea is to encourage those who read us to continue with open science practices.
- We practice inclusive language. Therefore, we seek the generic use of words that do not indicate any sex or gender in a preferential way: people, participants, who, among others.
- In the case of having to use a word that denotes sex and gender, we also indicate references to other genders and sexes: /a/e. This applies to both singular and plural.
- In general, both tone and speech should be respectful and clear. Words that, for cultural reasons, may be misunderstood in other cultures should be avoided.
- At OSL we are very respectful of other cultures, religious practices, political preferences, sports and, in general, we never address in our articles our personal preferences in any area that may be controversial and uncomfortable to those who read us. This is key to making this space a safe place where passion and interest in open science brings us together and encourages collaboration.
- Although articles may refer to personal experiences, it is always important to keep the focus of the writing on proposing a solution to a need for information or knowledge on the topics addressed.

## Workflow

- Each contributor establishes the pace of work that he/she will contribute to the portal and selects the topics and order in which they will be taken on, as well as the dates when they will be available for review.
- Each collaborator has an initial support from 1 to 3 weeks for wordpress management and first steps with the editing flow, as agreed by the OSL Board.
- Contributor writes the article from his/her account in the portal.
- Once the article is finished, along with the suggested images, it remains in draft form waiting for the person assigned to the revision to make a basic review of spelling, clarity and coherence.
- The person who reviews the article for publication is the one who must schedule its publication in the portal.
- The articles must have between 5 and 8 keywords that will be placed in the LABELS section of the article.
- Likewise, each article must have the category to which it belongs.
- Unless otherwise indicated or previously agreed, no contributor should edit other contributors' writings.
- Our contributors are encouraged to replicate their publications in our portal, through their personal social networks, as long as reference is made to OSL's social networks for their promotion.
