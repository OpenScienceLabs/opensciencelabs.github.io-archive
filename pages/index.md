Open science labs is a community that aims to gather people from all parts of the world,
specially from latin america countries and create an open space for teaching,
learning and sharing topics around open science and computational tools. An english group is very
important in this context because it increases the possibilities of collaboration in open projects.

## Community

We are using discord to organize our community. There you can decide which group you want to join,
for example python, c++, compilers, open science, devops, languages (English, Spanish) , etc.

Also, everyone is more than welcome to propose a study-group. If you want to study a specific topic,
and want to gather more people to study that with you, we encourage you to propose a study-group.

If you want to give a talk or tutorial about a specific topic, raise your voice in the channel
`#comm-general` and we will be more than happy to help you to hold this event on discord.

Join our community on <a href="http://opensciencelabs.org/discord">discord</a>.
