# Mentoring Code of Conduct

By accessing or using the OSL mentoring services, and thereby becoming a part of this community, you are agreeing to abide by our Code of Conduct.

Participants agree not to engage in any tortious or criminal activity and if you do engage in such activity, you understand that you are fully responsible to the fullest extent of the law and that you will retain your own legal counsel at your own expense, pay and all necessary fines and other costs and agree to hold OSL harmless. OSL is further indemnified for any actions that you take outside the scope of your contract and mentorship.

Participation is voluntary and participants shall fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend (collectively “indemnify” and “indemnification”) OSL and its staff or members from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, liabilities, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs), whether or not involving a third party claim, which arise out of or relate to (1) any breach of any representation or warranty of OSL contained in this Agreement, (2) any breach or violation of any covenant or other obligation or duty of OSL under this Agreement or under applicable law, (3) (4) (5)] [other enumerated categories of claims and losses], in each case whether or not caused by the negligence of OSL or any other Indemnified Party and whether or not the relevant Claim has merit.

#### Mentors

  * Not use any ideas, products or materials that a mentee has, or may develop, to further your own business or financial interests.
  * Maintain the confidentiality of all ideas, products or materials that have been entrusted to you by your mentee.

  * Both the mentor and the mentee have great responsibility to maintain and respect the confidentiality of all the information imparted during the mentoring relationship as they may hear sensitive and personal information.
